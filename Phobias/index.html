            <p class="accordingToHarvard">Acording to Harvard the concept of phobia is:</p>
                <p class="phobiasText1">
                Is a persistent, excessive, unrealistic fear of an object, person, animal, activity or situation. It is a type of anxiety disorder.
                A person with a phobia either tries to avoid the thing that triggers the fear, or endures it with great anxiety and distress.<br> 
                Some phobias are very specific and limited. For example, a person may fear only spiders (arachnophobia) or cats (ailurophobia). 
                In this case, the person lives relatively free of anxiety by avoiding the thing he or she fears.
                Some phobias cause trouble in a wider variety of places or situations.
                For example, symptoms of acrophobia (fear of heights) can be triggered by looking out the window of an office building or by driving over a high bridge.
                The fear of confined spaces (claustrophobia) can be triggered by riding in an elevator or by using a small restroom. People with these phobias may need to alter their lives drastically. 
                In extreme cases, the phobia may dictate the person's employment, job location, driving route, recreational and social activities, or home environment.
